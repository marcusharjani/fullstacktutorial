#hello world!




###Your journey to developing begins here.


##Day 1:

Today we set ourselves up with the basic tools used in developing of all sorts. 


###First
We learned that developing has three fundamental tools upon which all our work depends:


* [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - A good text editor
* [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) - The Command Line
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) - Source Control

(and used for sake of simplicity with Source control a fourth tool)

* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - Graphical Source Control


###Second
We learned some basic comand line commands. 

```
$
```
The command line is often referred to with a $.
```
$ls
```
Lists out all of the items in the current directory.
```
$cd DIRECTORY_NAME
```
Changes into the listed directory.
```
$mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME
```
Makes a new directory with a given name in the current directory.

We also learned that the command line is a non-graphical way in which to navigate the computer, and it begins in the home directory.

Further, we learned briefly that a mac computer comes with certain hidden programs installed, like the Python programming language.
```
$python -V
```
This command prints (or shows in on the command line) the current version of Python installed on our computer.


###Third
We learned that using BitBucket, we created a repository that lives in the cloud. Using Source Tree, we cloned that repository to our local machine - a fancy way of saying that we essentially copied that folder to our computer.  We opened that repository with Sublime Text (our text editor) and created a couple of folders and this README. After doing so, our new file appeared in source tree and we sent it up to the cloud through a process we will learn a lot more about later - called commit and push.
